## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `adder derive` rebuilds files from scans of the repository's Go source, with `--dry-run` to preview and `--out` to write elsewhere.
- `adder check` reports derived files that are out of date and exits with status 3, for CI.
- Scans by directory glob, exported names, first parameter name, and name pattern, with optional test files. Files adder generated are skipped, so outputs never feed back into scans.
- Scan items with `.Name`, `.Receiver`, `.Package`, `.Dir`, and `.File`, plus `.Module` from `go.mod`.
- Go outputs formatted with `gofmt` and marked with Go's standard generated-code header.
- Template functions with Sprout's names, including case conversion that understands acronyms and Go-style variants such as `toGoPascalCase`.
- Diagnostics with stable codes, file positions, and hints; every problem is reported at once.
- Exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for problems, 2 for usage mistakes, and 3 for stale outputs.
